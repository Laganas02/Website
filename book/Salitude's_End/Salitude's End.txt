Samatha is an introverted woman with a heart that yearns for solitude. 
Ngunit sa kabila ng kanyang pagnanais na manatiling mag-isa, destiny 
had other plans for her. As the only daughter of one of the biggest 
companies in Asia, hindi maiiwasang madamay siya sa mundong kanyang 
pinipilit iwasan. For the past years, she had successfully evaded social 
gatherings, avoiding a certain someone who caused her heartache like no other. 
Ngunit sa lahat ng bagay, may hangganan. The time has come for her to step out 
of the shadows and embrace her responsibilities. She needs to take care of 
their family's legacy, even if it means facing the possibility of encountering 
the one person she had desperately tried to forget.

Aziel Marcellus Cree, the man who shattered her heart into a million pieces. 
At sa pagtanggap niya sa kanyang tungkulin, alam niyang may malaking posibilidad 
na magkrus muli ang kanilang mga landas. Sa pagbabalik niya sa mundong kanyang 
iniwan, handa na ba siyang harapin ang mga alaala ng nakaraan?
